    <h3>Introduction to the Unit</h3>

    <p class="content-text">
     Welcome to Unit Five of Module Three. In the previous unit (Unit Four) you learnt about malaria parasite quantitation and how to 
	 identify and quantitate malaria parasites in thick and thin blood films. In this unit, you will learn about other non-malaria pathogens that may be seen in blood films.
    </p>
    
    <p class="content-text">
        This unit is divided into four topics corresponding to four types of non-malaria pathogens that may be found in blood films, as outlined in the learning outcomes in the next slide.

        <b class="noteText">
            Note that when examining thick and thin blood films for malaria parasites,
            other pathogenic organisms may be found. Recognising and reporting these other organisms is vital for
            identifying other causes of fever and for guiding correct treatment.<br>
			Rarely, malaria can co-exist with another infection so it is important to search for malaria parasites even if another parasite is seen in a blood film.

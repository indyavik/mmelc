<b>Welcome to Practical Exercise 3.3.1!</b>
<p>In this exercise we will go through several images of thin blood films, grouped by species of malaria parasites present.  
We will
first show the image alone, and then give you the chance to look at our annotations and notes.  While you are
not asked to identify the species yourself, please think about the features of the parasites as they relate
to the species.  Also remember that you can rarely identify species based on a single parasite&mdash;our identification 
was based on a thorough examination of the slide, not on these images alone.</p>

        Thin Blood Film Examination
    </h3>
    <p class="content-text">
        Although an indication of the different species of malaria parasites can be made from examining
        a thick blood film, species identification should always be confirmed be examining a thin blood film,
        as the structure of the parasites is maintained and faint morphological features of both parasites and
        erythrocytes can be more easily observed.



    </p>
    <p class="content-text">
        The ideal portion of a thin blood film for examination contains a single but dense layer of
        non-overlapping erythrocytes. This is termed the ‘area of ideal thickness’ and lies towards, but not at,
        the ‘feathered edge’ of the thin blood film.




    </p>
    <p class="content-text">
        As one moves to the less dense regions at the feathered edge, the erythrocytes maintain their form but examination takes longer as there are fewer cells in each field of view. As one moves towards the denser region of the thin blood film, the cells begin to overlap and may begin clumping together.
        Identifying parasites is possible in these regions (and sometimes necessary if an ideal region cannot
        be found in a blood film) but becomes more difficult. This is illustrated in the next slide.

<b>Welcome to Practical Exercise 3.4.1!</b>
<p>In this exercise you will estimate parasitaemia on three virtual slides.  Two of the slides are of thick blood films, and one is of a thin blood film.  
You will need to use tally counters in this exercise.  If you don't have tally counters, you could instead tally 
on a sheet of paper (but tally counters are highly recommended!)
</p><p>
Start in one corner of the image and scan back and forth through the entire image until you see a parasite.  At this point, on the thick blood films begin counting both parasites 
and white blood cells until you count 200 WBCs.  If at this point you have counted at least 100 parasites, calculate parasites/microlitre  
assuming 8,000 WBCs/microlitre.  If
you've counted fewer than 100 parasites, continue until you've counted 500 WBCs before performing the calculation.

</p><p>
On the thin blood film, count parasites and red blood cells until you've counted in 40 fields of view, then calculate assuming 5 million RBCs/microlitre.

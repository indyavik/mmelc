    <p class="content-text">
        Quality management system is defined as all the coordinated activities that direct and control an organisation or department with regard to quality. All aspects of laboratory operations, including organisational structure, processes and procedures need to be addressed to assure quality.

        ISO is the acronym for the International Organisation for Standardisation. ISO standards are produced through a consensus process between 162 member countries with the aim of creating global standards for product and service quality. These standards provide guidance for quality across a range of areas, such as manufacturing and service industries.

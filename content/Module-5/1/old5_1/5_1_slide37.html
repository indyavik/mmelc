       It is important to ensure that all documents for malaria microscopy are easily accessible to all technical staff. The documents that you develop for your laboratoryâ€™s use must be clear, concise, user-friendly, accurate and up-to-date. The laboratory must establish a documented procedure for identifying, collecting, indexing, accessing, storing, maintaining, amending and safely disposing of all documents and records.

   <p class="content-text">

      Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) are among the key documents required for all procedures involved in malaria microscopy. SOPs should be written in a manner and language that is appropriate to all laboratory personnel conducting malaria microscopy procedures.

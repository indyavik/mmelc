    <h3 class="medium-text">Staining Malaria Blood Films using 10% Giemsa Stain Solution</h3>

    <p class="content-text">
   The rapid (10% Giemsa stain working solution) method is the most common method for staining 1â€•15 slides at a time. The rapid method is used in outpatient clinics and busy laboratories where a quick diagnosis is an essential part of case management.
    </p>

    <p class="content-text">
       This method is efficient, but more stain is used. The need for speed justifies the additional cost. Each blood film needs approximately 3 mL of stain to cover it. Therefore you need to prepare the volume that corresponds to the number of slides to be stained.

    <h3 class="medium-text">Staining Malaria Blood Films using 3% Giemsa Stain Solution</h3>

    <p class="content-text">
   The slow (3% Giemsa stain working solution) method is used for staining larger numbers of slides (20 or more). It is ideal for staining blood films collected during cross-sectional or epidemiological surveys, field research or for preparing batches of slides for teaching.
    </p>

    <p class="content-text">
      This method is less appropriate when a quick result is needed. This method is less expensive than the rapid method because much less stain is used.

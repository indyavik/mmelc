        Quantitation Methods (2 of 6)

        Counting can begin at either the first field examined, irrespective of whether malaria parasites or WBCs have been seen,
        or as soon as the first parasite is detected; in usual clinical practice,
        counting begins when the first parasite is detected. Count both parasites and WBCs until 200 WBCs have been counted.
    </p>
    <p class="content-text">
        If 100 or more parasites have been counted at this point,
        you can proceed to perform the calculation that follows.
        If the parasite count is less than 100, continue counting asexual parasites
        and WBCs until 500 WBCs have been counted, then perform the calculation that follows.
        The formula for calculating parasite density per microlitre is the number of parasites
        counted divided by the number of WBCs counted, multiplied by 8,000.
        <b>
            The final result is rounded up or down to the nearest whole number.

        The last number, 8,000, is the ‘assumed’
        average number of WBCs in one microlitre (µL) of blood.
        In reality, the WBC count varies from patient to patient and
        if the true WBC count is known for that patient, this figure should be used in the calculation.

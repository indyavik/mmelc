<b>Welcome to Practical Exercise 3.2.2!</b>
<p>In this exercise you are asked to detect the presence of malaria parasites in 5 virtual slides.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Reminder on controlling the microscope:</b> <br>
Changing focus is done by clicking with the mouse on the scroll bar, or by using the "A" and "Q" keys on the keyboard.  
Focusing is slow in this software version, so please be patient.  When switching between focal planes too quickly, 
the software can temporarily freeze for several seconds before refreshing the view.<br><br>
Magnification is adjusted (up to x100) using the mouse scroll wheel or the + and - buttons on the keyboard.<br><br>
Scanning through the slide is done by using the arrow keys or by dragging and dropping with the mouse.  <br><br>
If the keyboard controls are not working, they can be enabled by clicking the image with the mouse.</p>

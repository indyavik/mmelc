        Importance of Malaria Parasite Quantitation


    </h2>
    <p class="content-text">
        Estimating malaria parasite count in a blood specimen (density of malaria parasites in blood) is essential
        for correct patient management. Parasite density is an indicator of the severity of malaria infection
        and is used to measure the response of the parasite to treatment.

    </p>
    <p class="content-text">
        For example, a parasite count of 100,000 parasites per microlitre (ÂµL) of
        blood indicates severe malaria, and continued elevated parasite counts after treatment indicate inadequate treatment,
        such as the wrong type or dose of antimalarial drug, failure of the patient to take the drug or parasite resistance to the antimalarial drug(s) used.

    </p>
    <p class="content-text">
        Counting parasites in a blood film only provides an
        estimate of parasite density, and some variation should be expected.
        This is due to the variation of parasite and white blood cell distribution in a blood film.
    </p>
    <p class="content-text">
        As an example, a microscopist reporting within 25% of the true parasite count (as determined by Level One microscopists) on at least half the slides during a WHO External Competency Assessment of Malaria Microscopists (ECAMM) can still receive Level 1
        (the highest level) certification. In routine clinical practice, a variation
        of plus or minus 50% of the true parasite count may be acceptable.

    <p class="content-text">
        The course is intended to provide information and guidance on all aspects of microscopy-based laboratory diagnosis of malaria. You will have access to an extensive image library developed using patient specimens from field laboratories. This is an attempt to replicate the actual laboratory experience. The electronic format used for the modules makes it easy for you to rapidly access course information on your laptop or desktop computer.
    </p>
    <p class="content-text">
        The course does NOT provide full detail on other diagnostic methods, case management, epidemiology or other aspects of malaria control and elimination, but aims to provide a sufficient overview of these areas to guide microscopists in their work.

On the left are two small images with malaria parasites in a thick blood film as well as a thin blood film with red blood cells.  These samples have been properly stained with Giemsa stain.  If you have experience in malaria microscopy, you may immediately notice whether the image colour looks correct or if, for example, it looks too blue and the parasite chromatin doesn't look red at all.  The image on the right shows a simple gradient between the 'chromatin-red' and the 'cytoplasm-blue'.  While the colour on the left should never look truly red, it should be closer to red or pink than to blue.  The colour on the right should be a more pure purple and closer to blue.  There should be a definite contrast between the two colours.";

Unfortunately all monitors are different and we cannot provide specific instructions.  You will likely want to increase the amount of red, while decreasing blue and green.</li>	<li><strong>Adjust your settings through your graphics card.</strong>  Most computers have some way to adjust the colour through the control of their graphics cards.  Unfortunately, all computers are different and we cannot provide instructions specific to any one machine.  These may be accessed by right-clicking on the desktop or through the control panel.  Again, it is likely that the red channel brightness or gamma needs be increased, while blue and green are decreased.</li>	<li><strong>Use the third-party program Gamma Panel</strong> to adjust your computer's settings.  We have included this free program on the course USB drive, and provide instructions in the following steps.  This program works on Windows versions as old as Windows 98 and all newer Windows operating systems.</li>	</ol>";

For us, slightly changing only the Gamma values was most successful&mdash;the provided profile has red gamma set to 1.1, green to 0.7, and blue to 0.6.

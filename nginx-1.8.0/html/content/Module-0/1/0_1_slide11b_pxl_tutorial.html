<b>Tally Counters</b>
<p>
When quantitating malaria parasites in a blood film, it is necessary to count parasites and white blood cells (thick blood film) or red blood cells (thin blood film). Typically this is done with tally counters.  We have provided two tally counters for using with the virtual microscope.
The first counter can be used for parasites, and the second for blood cells.
</p>

<p>
To access the tally counters, press the Tally Counters button above: 
</p>
<p>
<img id="counter_img" class="nav-img-pxl" onclick="" border="0" src="images/counter.png" alt="Display Tally Counters">
</p>
<p>
The counters can be controlled with the buttons "+", to add 1, "-", to subtract 1, or "C" to reset to zero.  The counters may also be incremented using the "E" and "R" keys on the keyboard.
</p>
<p>
Please open the tally counters and practice using the E and R keys as you scan through the slide.  To hide the tally counters, press the Tally Counters button again.

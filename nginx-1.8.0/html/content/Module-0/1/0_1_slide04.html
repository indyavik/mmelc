<p class = "content-text">
To navigate the slides within each unit, you will mostly use the navigation bar, which contains the following buttons:
</p>
<p class = "content-text">
<img class="nav-img-home" alt="Next Slide" src="images/forward.png" style="vertical-align:middle"> The Next button takes you to the next slide within a unit. If there is an activity to complete on the page, the Next button will be disabled until all activity is completed.
</p>
<p class = "content-text">
<img class="nav-img-home" alt="Previous Slide" src="images/backward.png" style="vertical-align:middle"> The Previous button takes you back one slide within a unit. If you are on the first page of a unit, the Previous button will be disabled.
</p>


<p class = "content-text">
To skip to another slide within the unit, you can use the menu at the bottom of the screen.
</p>

<p class = "content-text">
When you have reached the end of a unit, you will be notified to continue to the next unit by clicking on a button.  This will mark the unit as completed and send you to the next unit.
<p>

    <p  class="content-text full_width">
        <img src="images/Take Note.png" class="noteImgStyle"/>
        <b class="noteText">
            The slide navigation tools are not available during the pre- and post-tests, the post-module-assessments, and the Final Assessment.  You must answer each question before continuing to the next question, and if you navigate away, log out, or close the software before completing the tests you will need to start again.

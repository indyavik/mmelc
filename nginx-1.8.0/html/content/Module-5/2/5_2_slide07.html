        Internal Quality Control (IQC)</h3>

    <p class="content-text">Internal Quality Control (IQC) is a set of procedures undertaken by the laboratory to ensure the results of laboratory investigations are reliable enough to assist in clinical decision making, to be used for monitoring of therapy, and for the diagnosis of abnormalities, before release. </p>

    <p class="content-text">In the malaria diagnostic laboratory, IQC involves including reference materials in the analytical sequence and duplicate analysis. For example, IQC may involve including a positive thin blood film in your staining process to quality check newly prepared Giemsa Stain; examining positive malaria blood films as a reminder before starting to examine blood films from patients; and asking a colleague to check a positive malaria blood film with an uncommon species. </p>

        Quality Indicators (2 of 7)</h2>

    <h3 class="medium-text">
        Specimen and Patient Identification</h3>

    <p class="content-text">Specimens must be correctly identified as coming from the patient from whom the specimen is obtained. The potential for patient and specimen misidentification to cause serious patient injury (sometimes fatal) qualifies this to be recognised as a key quality indicator.</p>

	<h3 class="medium-text">
	Specimen Acceptability and Rejection</h3>

	<p class="content-text">A rejected specimen is a specimen for which one or more requested tests cannot be performed because the specimen does not meet the required laboratory standards for acceptability. This indicator is expressed as a percentage of specimens rejected and not tested due to reasons such as blood clotting, haemolysis, insufficient specimen, wrong collection tube, wrong anticoagulant or specimen leakage.</p> 

	<p class="content-text">For malaria microscopy, clotted specimens are not acceptable as parasites may be trapped in the clot. You must therefore develop specimen rejection criteria in the reception area of your malaria microscopy department. </p>

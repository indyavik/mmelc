	Turnaround Time (TAT)</h3>

	<p class="content-text">The Turnaround Time (TAT) indicator refers to the percentage of laboratory tests that do not meet the agreed reporting timelines. The speed at which laboratory results are reported greatly impact patient care. Turnaround Time (TAT) is a major indicator of the quality of a malaria microscopy service. </p>

        Critical Values Reporting</h3>

    <p class="content-text">Critical Values Reporting is the mechanism by which potentially life-threatening laboratory results are provided directly to caregivers, such as through a telephone call or delivering the report directly to the requesting clinician. An example of a critical value is a high parasite density in an unconscious patient. Reporting of critical values is a vital procedure due to the impact the results may have on clinical decision-making and patient survival. </p>

	<p class="content-text">The Turnaround Time (TAT) indicator refers to the percentage of laboratory tests that do not meet the agreed reporting deadlines.

        Critical Values Reporting</h3>

    <p class="content-text">Critical Values Reporting is the mechanism by which potentially life-threatening laboratory results are given directly to caregivers, such as a telephone call or delivering the report directly to the requesting clinician. An example of a critical value is a high parasite density in an unconscious patient. Reporting of critical values is a vital procedure due to the impact it may have on clinical decision-making and patient survival. </p>

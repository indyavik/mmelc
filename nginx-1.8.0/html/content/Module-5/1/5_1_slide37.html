       It is important to ensure that all documents and records for malaria microscopy are easily accessible and retrievable by all technical staff. The documents that you develop for your laboratoryâ€™s use must be clear, concise, user-friendly, accurate and up-to-date. The laboratory must establish a documented procedure for identification, collection, indexing, access, storage, maintenance, amendment and safe disposal of all documents and records.

   <p class="content-text">

      Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) are among the key documents required for malaria microscopy. SOPs should be written in a manner and language that is appropriate for the laboratory personnel conducting malaria microscopy procedures.

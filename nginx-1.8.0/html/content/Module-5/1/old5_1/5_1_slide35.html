    </p>

 <ul class="u-list">

        <li class="m-b-5">Incomplete or illegible results for test interpretation. </li>

        <li class="m-b-5">Inadequate patient identification systems.</li>

        <li class="m-b-5">Forms that are inadequately designed to meet laboratory and user needs.</li>

        <li class="m-b-5">Standardised forms prepared by others that may not be suitable for your laboratoryâ€™s needs.</li>

        <li class="m-b-5">Inability to retrieve data due to poor archiving processes or insufficient backup of computerised information.</li>

        <li class="m-b-5">Poor data organisation, which may hinder later data analysis to meet research or other needs.</li>

        <li class="m-b-5">Incompatibility between computerised information systems and other electronic systems, resulting in problems with data transmission. </li>

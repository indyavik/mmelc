    <p class="content-text">
        Process control is an essential element of the Quality Management System. It refers to control of procedures for handling and examining specimens to ensure accurate and reliable testing. Process control comprises appropriate management of specimens, including collection and handling, quality control of the testing process and method verification and validation.

    <p class="content-text">
        In your malaria microscopy department, you are required to develop a laboratory handbook that provides information on proper specimen management. All laboratory and clinical staff involved in specimen collection should be familiar with the contents of the laboratory handbook including the following:

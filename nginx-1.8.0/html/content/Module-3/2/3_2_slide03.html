	Module Two of this course covers standard blood specimen preparation and explains why Giemsa stain is recommended by the World Health Organization for staining blood films for malaria. Therefore all images presented in this course are of Giemsa-stained blood films. However, the content of this course will also be valuable to those who use other Romanowsky stains (for instance, Wright's, Field's, May-Gr√ºnwald, JSB, among others), although differences in colouration may be noted.</b>

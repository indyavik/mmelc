	Thick Blood Film</h3>

	<p class="content-text">In a thick blood film, a specified volume of blood is spread thickly over a small area. In the staining procedure for a thick blood film, the erythrocytes are lysed during the staining process because the film is not fixed before staining.</p>

	<p class="content-text">The thick blood film is used for initial detection of malaria parasites, preliminary determination of malaria species and parasite counting, as it is more densely packed than the thin blood film and several layers of blood cells are examined in each field.</p>

        General Morphological Features of Malaria Parasites (1 of 2)
    </h2>
    <p class="content-text">
        The morphological features common to each stage and all species of malaria parasites are
        the nucleus which stains dark red and is refractile (shiny); the cytoplasm which stains blue;
        a vacuole which appears as a clear space within the cytoplasm; and malaria pigment which may be brown or black. The vacuole may not be apparent in gametocytes.
    </p>

    <p class="content-text">
        The two critical features for identification of malaria parasites are the nucleus and the cytoplasm.

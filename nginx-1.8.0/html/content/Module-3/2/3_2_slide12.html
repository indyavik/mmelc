        Thick Blood Film Examination (2 of 2)
    </h2>
    <p class="content-text">
        The fine focus adjustment is used to be able to clearly see the structures throughout the thickness
        of the film in each field. During examination, an indication of possible malaria parasite species is assessed (described in Unit Three); and malaria parasites and leucocytes are counted.

    </p>
    <p class="content-text">
        A blood specimen should not be reported as ‘no malaria parasites seen’
        until at least 100 oil immersion fields of the thick blood film have been carefully examined.
        Some programmes require a different number of fields to be examined before reporting a ‘no malaria parasites seen’ result.

        <b class="noteText">
            The wording when parasites are not observed in a blood film&mdash;‘no malaria parasites seen’&mdash;is preferable to ‘malaria parasites negative’, as the former correctly
            suggests that the sample may actually be positive at a level below that detectable given the time and conditions under which the film was examined.

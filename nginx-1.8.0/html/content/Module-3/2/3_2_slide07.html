	Thin Blood Film</h3>

	<p class="content-text">In a thin blood film, the blood is spread thinly across the slide. In the staining procedure for a thin blood film, the erythrocytes remain intact because the film is fixed in methanol before the staining process. Therefore any malaria parasites seen (trophozoites, schizonts and gametocytes) are inside the red blood cells.</p>

	<p class="content-text">The fixing process also preserves the morphology (appearance) of all blood cells and malaria parasites so their components can be easily recognised. The area of ideal thickness for examination of a thin blood film contains a single layer of red blood cells. In this area the morphological structure of blood cells and parasites can be best observed.</p>

	<p class="content-text">The thin blood film is not used for initial malaria parasite detection because parasites may be hard to find in blood films with low parasite counts; instead the thin blood film is used for the definitive diagnosis of the malaria parasite species once parasites have been detected in the thick blood film.</p>

        Practical Exercises
    </h2>
    <p class="content-text">
        The final section of this unit is designed to enable you
        to gain practical skills in examining thick blood films.
        The best way to learn to recognise malaria parasites is with practice.
        Rather than describing in detail all the possible parasite forms, you will instead be presented with many examples.

    </p>
    <p class="content-text">
        There are two practical exercises that make use of the
        virtual microscope associated with this unit.
        In the first, 48 individual microscopic images of
        thick blood films are presented, and you will be asked whether
        the image contains malaria parasites or not. You will encounter
        many different forms of parasites in this exercise, and after each
        question is answered you will be provided with the correct answer and an explanation.
        Although you are not asked to identify the species in these images, occasionally features unique to each species will be described.

    <p class="content-text">

        Effective examination of a thick blood film involves scanning the slide from top to bottom,
        to be able to examine different areas of the blood film and not just looking at a few individual images.
    </p>
    <p class="content-text">
        In the second practical exercise, you will be presented with 5 larger virtual slides and asked to detect whether malaria parasites are present in the larger image,
        which will require scanning through the slide. Remember
        to set your objective lens to x100 (for x1,000 total magnification) and scan through the entire thick blood film!
    </p>

        Note that in these and other practical exercises, you will occasionally be presented with a poorly prepared blood film, making definitive identification of parasites difficult.  This will highlight the importance of properly preparing blood films!

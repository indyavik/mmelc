        Thick Blood Film Examination (1 of 2)
    </h2>
    <p class="content-text">
        Malaria parasite detection and quantitation (described in Unit Four)
        are usually performed on thick blood films. The Giemsa-stained blood slide is placed on
        the microscope stage and the condenser and iris diaphragm adjusted. The thick blood film is
        first briefly scanned using the x10 objective lens to determine the overall thickness and staining quality, and to detect large parasites (microfilariae).

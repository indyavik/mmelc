	Examination of Giemsa-Stained Blood Films by Microscopy</h3>

	<p class="content-text">The following picture is of a standard Giemsa-stained blood slide. This slide has both a thick blood film (a) and a thin blood film (b), as is commonly prepared for malaria diagnosis. The arrow indicates the ‘area of ideal thickness’ of the thin blood film, which is the area used when examining the thin blood film.</p>

	<p class="content-text">When examining blood films for the diagnosis of malaria, a x100 oil immersion microscope objective lens is used with x10 eyepieces, giving a total magnification of x1,000.</p>

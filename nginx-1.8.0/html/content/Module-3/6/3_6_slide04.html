        <p class="content-text">
  		 To prevent artefacts, blood films should not be dried in dusty environments or left exposed to insects. During finger prick specimen collection, the prick area should be cleaned with a cotton wool pad soaked in alcohol and allowed to air dry. The slide for blood film preparation should not be allowed to touch the pricked area of the skin.
    </p>

    	<p class="content-text">
     		Stains should be filtered before use, and buffers should be freshly prepared to avoid growth of bacteria and fungi. New microscope slides should be used if possible; if it is necessary to reuse slides they must be thoroughly washed in detergent and carefully rinsed.
</p>

 	<p class="content-text">
     		Distilled water used for preparing buffers for stain dilution or washing blood films during staining should be stored in well stoppered containers to avoid contamination with moulds and bacteria.

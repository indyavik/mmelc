        <p class="content-text">
  		 The presence of artefacts and poorly prepared blood films can make examination of blood films very difficult, and can lead to major errors in diagnosis. While good blood specimen collection and proper technique for preparing and staining blood films can prevent many artefacts, recognising artefacts―most importantly not misidentifying an artefact as a malaria parasite―is an important skill for a microscopist.

    	<p class="content-text">
     		It is also useful to be able to recognise improperly prepared blood films to judge whether a valid diagnosis can be made with a particular blood film, or whether a new blood film should be prepared.

 	<p class="content-text">
     		Artefacts in blood films can lead to false positive reports from the laboratory. These artefacts include dust or other contaminants deposited on exposed blood films, stain deposits from use of unfiltered stain, contaminants in buffer, or material on reused microscope slides that have not been properly cleaned in detergent or carefully rinsed.

	<p class="content-text">
     		Artefacts that can be seen include fungi, yeasts, bacteria and bacteria attached to fibrin, stain deposits, Giemsa stain crystals, cotton wool, vegetable cells, fungal spores, pollen grains and other contaminants present in water.

     		The practical exercise at the end of this unit will lead you through several examples of artefacts that may be found in blood films.

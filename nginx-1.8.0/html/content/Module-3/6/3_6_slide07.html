        It is also possible that a thin blood film is not fixed or is under-fixed. Thin blood films must be fixed before staining so the blood cells retain their morphology. The most common cause of this is simply forgetting to fix the thin blood film. In this case, the thin blood film may wash away completely during staining.

        Under-fixing may be caused by using low quality or hydrated methanol (methanol contaminated with water). Methanol can be contaminated with water directly or by leaving it open to the environment when it absorbs moisture from the air. Below is an image of a thin blood film that has been poorly fixed:

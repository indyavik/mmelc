<b>Welcome to Practical Exercise 3.3.3!</b>
<p>In this exercise we will go through 9 larger virtual slides of thin blood films.  You are asked to identify the species
of malaria parasites present in each virtual slide.  There are often only a few parasites present in the entire large image.
Additionally, there are some mixed species infections, so please look through the entire virtual slide before answering!
</p><p>
Even though these images are larger than the images in the previous exercises, we are still showing only a small region of each thin blood films. 
Occasionally there are very few parasites present and the species cannot be reliably determined from this small image.  But there
are still clues in the features of the parasites, so even if you are not sure, note the features before checking the answers.
As in the previous two exercises, our identification was based on a thorough examination of each entire slide.

            In Practical Exercise 3.3.1, you will be shown 34 photomicrographs of each species of malaria parasite,
            grouped by species. You are not asked to identify the species, but are encouraged to carefully examine the images and think about
            the features that would be used in identification.

        </p>
        <p class="content-text">
            In Practical Exercise 3.3.2, you will be asked to identify the species of malaria parasite present in 33 individual photomicrographs of thin blood films.

            Finally, in Practical Exercise 3.3.3, you will be presented with 9 larger virtual slides of thin blood films.
            The four main human-infecting species of malaria will be included,
            as well as some mixed species infections. Please scan through the entire slide, even if you feel you have already identified the species.

        Morphology of Malaria Parasites by Species and Stage
    </h3>
    <p class="content-text">
        In Unit Two you were introduced to the general forms of malaria parasites in thick blood films,
        as well as their species, in the practical exercises. Here you will briefly describe the features unique to each species,
        followed by more practical exercises to demonstrate them.
    </p>
    <p class="content-text">
        For each species, you will be shown drawings that  
        summarise the features of malaria parasites that can be seen when examining thick blood films
		(adapted and reprinted with permission from the World Health Organization).  You will also be shown several thin
		blood film photomicrographs for each species and stage.  At the end of the unit, practical exercises using
		the virtual microscope are presented.

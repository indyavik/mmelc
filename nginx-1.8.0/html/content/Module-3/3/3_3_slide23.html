            Algorithm for Species Identification

            In Module One, you were presented with a brief algorithm that the microscopist
            can use to identify malaria parasite species. The algorithm is presented again here,
            and you are encouraged to think about this algorithm as it pertains to the images and
            descriptions you have covered in this unit. As you go through the practical exercises, keep this algorithm in mind.

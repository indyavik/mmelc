<b>Welcome to Practical Exercise 3.3.2!</b>
<p>In this exercise we will go through several images of thin blood films, similar to the last exercise.  
But now the images are not grouped by species, and we don't identify species for you!  
</p><p>
On each page, please carefully think about the features of the parasites in relation to species and stage 
before clicking on an answer. 
</p><p>
Once again, remember that you can rarely identify species based on a single parasite or image&mdash;our identification 
was based on a thorough examination of the slide, not on these images alone.  So we do not expect you to be able
to identify all the parasites on your first attempt. </p>

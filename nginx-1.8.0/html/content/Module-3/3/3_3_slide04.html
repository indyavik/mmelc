        Malaria Parasite Species (2 of 6)

    </h2>
    <p class="content-text">
        This module will focus on the diagnostic characteristics of the first four species.
        <i>P. knowlesi</i> occurs in monkeys in Southeast Asia, but can be transmitted by infected mosquitoes to humans.
        <i>P. knowlesi</i> is morphologically similar to <i>P. malariae</i>, and cannot be identified using microscopy alone.


    </p>
    <p class="content-text">
        It is essential to determine accurately the species of malaria for effective treatment.
        There are currently a limited number of drugs used to treat malaria. Most of these target
        the blood stages of the parasites so eliminating <i>P. falciparum</i> and <i>P. malariae</i> parasites from the blood is
        sufficient for cure.


    </p>
    <p class="content-text">
        The treatment of <i>P. vivax</i> and <i>P. ovale</i> requires the addition of a tissue schizonticide, such as primaquine, to eliminate the hypnozoite,
        the dormant liver stage of these species. <i>P. falciparum</i> and <i>P. knowlesi</i> 
		infections can lead to rapidly fatal disease and must be treated without delay.

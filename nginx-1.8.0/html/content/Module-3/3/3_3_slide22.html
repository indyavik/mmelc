            Mixed Malaria Infections

        </h2>
        <p class="content-text">
            Mixed malaria infections occur when more than one species of malaria is present in a single blood film.
            Mixed malaria infections are recognised by the presence of stages that are unique to the different species of
            <i>Plasmodium</i> parasites. For example, there may be a crescentic <i>P. falciparum</i> gametocyte in the same blood 
			film as a mature trophozoite of 
			<i>P. vivax</i> showing an amoeboid, vacuolated parasite in a stippled, enlarged and distorted erythrocyte.
        </p>
        <p class="content-text">
            Similarly, a <i>P. falciparum</i> gametocyte may be observed as well as an enlarged,
            compact, vacuolated trophozoite in an ovoid, stippled cell with projections at the narrow ends characteristic of 
			<i>P. ovale</i>. Differences in early trophozoite morphology should not be used to indicate a mixed infection 
			because early trophozoites of all species are often similar. The rosette arrangement of 6&ndash;8 merozoites associated with the schizont 
			of <i>P. malariae</i> can also be observed in other species.

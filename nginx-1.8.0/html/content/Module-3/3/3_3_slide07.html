        Thin Blood Film Examination

    <p class="content-text">
        As with the thick blood film, an oil immersion objective lens with x100 magnification is used
        for examining a thin blood film for malaria parasites. A cross-sectional pattern covering the area of ideal
        thickness should be followed, similar to the pattern shown in the image that follows.

            Lower power objective lenses (x4, x10, x40) are used for examining blood films for
            a full haematological assessment, as well as for detecting large blood parasites,
            such as microfilariae.

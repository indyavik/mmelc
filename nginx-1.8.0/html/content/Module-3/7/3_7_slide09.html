       		Well done! You have come to the end of this module. Read through this summary to remind yourself of what you have learnt in all the seven (7) units.
        </p>

	<p class="content-text">
       		In Unit One, you learnt about normal and abnormal blood components; in Unit Two, you improved your knowledge and skills on how to detect malaria parasites in thick and thin blood films; in Unit Three you were able to correctly identify the different human malaria species in blood films; and in Unit Four you accurately quantitated these malaria parasites.
        </p>

	<p class="content-text">
       		In the final three units you were able to identify non-malaria pathogens; recognise artefacts and contaminants in thick and thin blood films; and lastly recognise the importance and format of quality reporting of blood film examinations.
        </p>

       		Congratulations! Feel free to review any materials to improve your knowledge and skills on the topics covered. Take a moment to complete the End-of-Module assessment before you proceed to Module Four of the Worldwide E-Learning Course on Malaria Microscopy.

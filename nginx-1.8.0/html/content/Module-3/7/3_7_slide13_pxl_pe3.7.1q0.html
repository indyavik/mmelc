<b>Welcome to Practical Exercise 3.7.1!</b>
<p>In this exercise you will make a diagnosis on four blood specimens.  Each sample includes virtual slides of both thick and thin blood films.  
Read these slides as you
would real slides&mdash;first attempt to detect parasites in the thick blood film.  If parasites are seen, think about the species while you count parasites in the thick blood film.  
Switch over to the thin blood film for confirmation of species identification.  Finally, enter your report to the clinician in the text box.

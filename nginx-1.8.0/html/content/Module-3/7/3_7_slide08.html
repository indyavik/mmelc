       		In this exercise, you will use many of the skills you have practised throughout this module. You will be shown virtual slides from 4 cases of suspected malaria. For each case, virtual slides of both thick and thin blood films will be provided. Make a diagnosis and report your results to the clinician and make the relevant entries in the laboratory register.

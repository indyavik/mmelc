       		The result of the blood film examination must be recorded in the laboratory register, which stays in the laboratory. The table that follows is an example of a laboratory register. The register is part of the laboratory data management system. Once again, if your laboratory register is missing any critical information it should be modified.

		<b class="noteText">As discussed in Unit Two, samples in which parasites are not observed are reported as 'No Malaria Parasites Seen' or NMPS, rather than 'Negative for malaria parasites'.</b> 


 <p class="content-text">
		As a reminder, at least 100 oil immersion fields of a thick blood film should be examined before reporting 'No malaria parasites seen'.

        <b class="noteText">There is no universal standard format for reporting results to the clinician, but consistency at any site is important. If your current reporting format is missing any of the information described previously, it should be rectified, as this detailed information is required by the clinician to correctly manage the patient. Discuss with the clinicians to agree on reporting formats. </b>
		
		<p class = "content-text">The following are three examples of what might be written in a report delivered to the clinician to guide patient management:</p>

    <ul class="u-list">
	<li class="m-b-5"><b><i>P. falciparum</i> trophozoites seen; 4,320 parasites/µL. </b></li>

        <li class="m-b-5"><b><i>P. falciparum</i> and <i>P. vivax</i> trophozoites seen; schizonts and gametocytes of <i>P. vivax</i> seen. Total count 2,670 parasites/µL.</b></li>

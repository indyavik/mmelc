<h3>Introduction to the Unit</h3>
	<p class="content-text">
       		In the previous unit you identified common artefacts in blood films. Now, in this final unit, you need to think about how to communicate your microscopy findings. You will learn how to prepare quality reports which communicate accurately the results of your examination to the clinician or health professional requesting the tests.
        </p>

       		You are now well grounded to cover this unit, which is on the format of the report, procedures for reporting and common deficiencies in reporting.

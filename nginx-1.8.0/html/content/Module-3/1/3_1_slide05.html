        Erythrocytes (3 of 10): Morphology</h2>

    <p class="content-text">Occasionally, erythrocytes in a thin blood film may be crenated. Crenation is the formation of projections of the erythrocyte membrane when the cell loses volume due to ingestion of its contents by a malaria parasite, or when the cell is exposed to a hypertonic (highly salty) solution. Because the cell membrane does not shrink, it produces folds which are seen as projections. </p>


    <p class="content-text">The following image illustrates several crenated erythrocytes (black arrows, not all are labelled) and otherwise deformed erythrocytes in a thin blood film. A platelet is also present (red arrow).</p>

	Erythrocytes (5 of 10): Iron Deficiency Anaemia</h2>

	<p class="content-text">The most common erythrocyte disorder results from insufficient iron for production of haemoglobin (iron deficiency anaemia). Lack of iron results in small red blood cells with an enlarged area of central pallor (hypochromic, microcytic cells).

Most of these cells are hypochromic (enlarged area of central pallor) and several are microcytic (smaller than usual). Anisocytosis (variation in red cell size) is also present.</figcaption>

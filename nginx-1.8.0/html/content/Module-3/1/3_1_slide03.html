	<p class="content-text">Erythrocytes are the most numerous cells in blood, with a range of 4&ndash;6 million per microlitre. Red blood cells contain haemoglobin that transports oxygen and carbon dioxide around the body and gives blood its red colour.</p>

	<p class="content-text">Erythrocytes are the host cells of the malaria parasite in the erythrocytic stage of the parasite cycle (outside the liver).</p>

	Red blood cells are only seen in thin blood films, when the blood film is fixed before staining. In a properly prepared thick blood film, erythrocytes are lysed and are not visible, although diffuse erythrocyte stroma (cellular material) may be seen. </b>

	Platelets (1 of 2): Morphology</h2>

	<p class="content-text">As with the previous section you will first describe and view slides on the morphology (appearance) and function of platelets before examining platelet abnormalities and their clinical significance.</p>

	<p class="content-text">Platelets are small bodies in blood, about 2 Î¼m in diameter, with frilled edges and without nuclei. Platelets can be mistaken for malaria parasites, especially when the platelets overlie red cells as illustrated in the following images.</p>

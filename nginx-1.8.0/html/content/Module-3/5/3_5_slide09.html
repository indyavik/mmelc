	<p class="content-text">
		<i>Babesia</i> spp. are blood-dwelling protozoan parasites that are morphologically similar to malaria parasites, 
		especially young trophozoites of <i>P. falciparum</i>. The parasites are transmitted by ticks and invade 
		erythrocytes. Only trophozoites and dividing trophozoites are seen in stained blood films.
        </p>

	<p class="content-text">
		Symptoms of babesiosis are similar to those of malaria. In stained blood films, the parasites show conspicuous 
		vacuoles, very delicate cytoplasm and red chromatin. The two most common species are <i>B. microti</i> and <i>B. divergens</i>.
        </p>

	<p class="content-text">
		Most cases have been reported from North America. Some features that help in differentiating 
		<i>Babesia</i> from malaria parasites are: the presence of rings outside (as well as inside) red blood cells, 
		the absence of other parasite stages, a cross-like formation of dividing trophozoites in red blood cells, 
		and the patient's history that includes travel to North America, excludes travel to malaria-endemic regions or otherwise excludes exposure to malaria.

        <i>Borrelia</i> in Blood Films (1 of 2)


    </h2>

    <p class="content-text">
       <i> Borrelia </i>is a genus of spirochaetes (spiral bacteria) that cause relapsing fever
        in humans which can lead to meningoencephalitis and fatal disease. The causative organisms are <i>B. crocidurae</i> in West Africa, and <i>B. duttoni</i> and <i>B. recurrentis</i> in eastern Africa.

    </p>
    <p class="content-text">
        <i>Borrelia</i> organisms are transmitted by ticks or body lice.
        The disease can present with similar symptoms to malaria, but requires antibiotic treatment for cure. In stained blood films, <i>Borrelia</i> organisms present as faintly staining spirals about 20 Âµm long.

    </p>
    <p class="content-text">
        <i> B. burgdorferi, B. afzelli,</i> and <i>B. garinii </i>cause Lyme disease, a tick-borne disease which presents with skin rash and joint pain. Lyme disease, which is most
        common in North America, Europe and Asia, is usually diagnosed by detecting antibodies in blood rather than detecting the bacteria directly in blood films.

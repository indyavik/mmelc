We examined this entire portion of the film, and counted 83 parasites (23 gametocytes, 60 trophozoites) and 1,320 white blood cells.  60/1,320*8,000 = 364 trophozoites/microlitre.  Our collaborators who provided this slide calculated 640 trophozoites/microlitre when looking at the slide through a real microscope.  If your count was between about 250 and 800 parasites/microlitre, you've done a good job on this fairly difficult slide.  Assuming you performed the calculation correctly, if you're below this range, you likely missed some parasites; if you're above this range you likely counted some non-parasites, and perhaps included gametocytes in the count.<br><br>";

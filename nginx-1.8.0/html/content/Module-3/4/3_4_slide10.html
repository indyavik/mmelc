        In this unit's practical exercise, Practical Exercise 3.4.1, you are provided with 3
        photomicrographs of thick blood films. Scan each thick blood
        film in a cross-sectional pattern at x100 objective magnification
        (equivalent to x1,000 <b>total</b> magnification) for malaria parasites.
</p>
    <p class="content-text">
    In the first field where you see an asexual malaria parasite,
    start counting parasites using one tally counter and use another tally counter
    to count the number of white blood cells (WBCs) in that field. Continue counting
    the WBCs and parasites in consecutive fields until you have counted 200 WBCs or more,
    including fields with either no parasites or no WBCs.

</p>
    <p class="content-text">
        If at this point you have counted fewer than 100 parasites,
        continue counting until you have counted at least 500 WBCs. 
        After you have finished counting, use the formula given previously to estimate the parasite density per microlitre.
    </p>

    <p class="content-text">
        You will also be asked to perform quantitation on a thin blood film.
        In this case, you should count numbers of red blood cells (RBCs) and infected RBCs until
        you have gone through at least 20 fields and/or counted at least 5,000 total RBCs.

            The field of view using the virtual microscope at x100 is much smaller than you would see through a real microscope.

        Quantitation Methods (1 of 6)

    </h2>
    <p class="content-text">
        Quantitation of malaria parasites is usually performed on a thick blood film.
        This method provides an estimation of the number of parasites in a known volume of blood by counting the number
        of parasites seen against the number of white blood cells (WBCs) seen.

    </p>
    <p class="content-text">
        The thick blood film is examined using the x100 oil
        immersion objective lens, and counts are recorded on two tally counters or a double-key counter,
        using one counter for malaria parasites and the other for WBCs. In each field, all parasites and
        all WBCs are counted before continuing to the next field. Typically, only asexual forms of the parasites (trophozoites and schizonts)
        are included in the count, although the presence of gametocytes must also be reported.
		For <i>P. vivax</i> and <i>P. malariae</i>, it may be difficult to reliably distinguish gametocytes from asexual parasites and therefore these forms may be counted together.

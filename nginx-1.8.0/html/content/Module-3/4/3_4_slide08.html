            In cases where there is a very high parasite count (greater than 100 parasites present in each field of the thick blood film),
            or when a thick blood film is not available or is unsuitable, thin blood films can be used for malaria parasite counting.
            At x1,000 total magnification, each field in the area of ideal thickness in a thin blood film contains approximately 250 red blood cells (RBCs).
        </p>

        <p class="content-text">
            The infected RBCs are counted against all the RBCs in at least 20 fields or
            until 5,000 total RBCs have been counted. The formula for calculating parasite
            density per microlitre is the number of infected RBCs divided by the total number
            of RBCs counted, multiplied by 5,000,000. The final result is rounded up or down to the nearest whole number.

            5,000,000 is taken as the assumed average number of RBCs in one microlitre (ÂµL) of blood .
            Again, this varies from patient to patient and if the true RBC count is known for a patient, this figure should be used in the calculation.

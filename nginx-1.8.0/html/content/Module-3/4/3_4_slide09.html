        When multiple species of malaria parasites are observed,
        all asexual parasites are generally counted together and the presence of multiple species
        is reported along with this single parasite count. In some settings, for example in research and drug
        sensitivity screening, it is beneficial for each species to be counted separately. Reporting of results is described
        in Unit Seven of this module.

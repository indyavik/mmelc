	Collection of Blood Specimens (1 of 3)</h2>

	<p class="content-text">As has been described, there are two techniques used for blood collection for preparing blood films for malaria microscopy namely, finger prick and venepuncture.</p>

	<p class="content-text">Capillary blood obtained by finger prick is preferred for preparing blood films for malaria diagnosis. However, venous blood specimens may be collected for multiple tests, which may include malaria diagnosis by microscopy and other haematological investigations. </p>

	<p class="content-text">A larger volume of blood is collected through the venepuncture technique. Venous blood is collected and stored in tubes containing an anticoagulant. Of available anticoagulants, ethylenediamine-tetraacetic acid (EDTA) causes the least effects on parasite staining. EDTA prevents blood from clotting by binding calcium. However, EDTA may affect adhesion of blood to the glass slide during blood film preparation. Heparin should not be used as anticoagulant because it affects the morphology of blood cells and staining characteristics.</p>

	<p class="content-text">After collecting a blood specimen, whether by finger prick or venepuncture, it is important to appropriately discard infectious and non-infectious waste.  It is useful to have a colour-coded system, for example:</p>
	
	<ul class="u-list">
		<li class="m-b-5"><b>Highly infectious waste bin</b> (with a red liner) for wastes such as blood-stained gloves, blood-stained cotton wool that was used to stop bleeding after venepuncture and any other waste that contains body fluid. </li>

		<li class="m-b-5"><b>Infectious waste bin</b> (with a yellow liner) for wastes that were in contact with the patient but did not contact blood or any other body fluid.  This may include gloves and the alcohol swabs that were used to clean the puncture site. </li>

		<li class="m-b-5"><b>Non-infectious waste bin</b> (with a black liner) for wastes such as paper and syringe covers. </li>
	</ul>

    <p class="content-text">
       In Unit Three, you learnt that Giemsa stain is an alcohol-based Romanowsky stain and is the stain of choice for malaria microscopy. You learnt how to prepare buffered distilled water of pH 7.2 which is recommended for use in diluting Giemsa stain.

    <p class="content-text">
       You also learnt how to prepare Giemsa stain stock solution using quality reagents and Giemsa stain working solution. You learnt that for accurate malaria diagnosis, 
	   Giemsa staining reagents should be prepared according to recommended standard operating procedures including quality control of staining reagents to ensure
	   proper performance of newly prepared staining solutions.
    </p>

	In Unit Four you learnt how to stain blood films using the rapid (10%) and slow (3%) methods and how to stain films 
	individually and in batches. You learnt that thin blood films must be fixed in absolute methanol before staining, and that 
	thick blood films should never be fixed. You learnt that blood films 
	should not be artificially dried. You also learnt how to mount, store and archive stained blood films for future reference.

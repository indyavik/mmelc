          <p class="content-text">
            Temporary slide holders are made from strong and durable cardboard and are designed to store and/or transport blood slides safely. They can also be used for protecting drying blood slides from dust and insects. They come in different sizes, from those that can carry a few slides to larger ones which can take up to 20 slides. They have hinged covers with a durable top. There is usually an inventory index printed on the side of the cover for quick reference.

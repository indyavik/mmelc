    <p class="content-text">
        A lateral flow assay is known as a sandwich assay. It uses antibodies to capture antigen (usually protein) from a sample,
        and bind it to a line on a nitrocellulose strip. The first (signal) antibody is bound (conjugated) to a minute particle (nanoparticle).
        If a sufficient quantity of the antibody-nanoparticle-antigen complex accumulates on the test line,
        the line becomes visible and the test is positive.

    <p class="content-text">
        Most malaria RDTs are supplied as plastic cassettes&mdash;the nitrocellulose strip and absorbent pads are enclosed within the cassette,
        with windows for the test sample and a buffer to promote flow, and a window to allow the test and control lines to be viewed.

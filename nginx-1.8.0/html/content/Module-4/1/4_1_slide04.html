	Detecting Parasites for Case Management Screening and other Applications (2 of 3)</h2>

	<p class="content-text">As malaria is a disease&mdash;a group of symptoms and signs caused by the presence of malaria parasites&mdash;diagnosis involves detecting parasites in a person with typical signs and  symptoms of malaria and no other obvious cause of illness at a parasite density (count) that is sufficient to cause these symptoms.</p>

	<p class="content-text">It is well known that people can carry parasites in their blood without having significant symptoms&ndash;usually with very low parasite density, for example <5 parasites/ÂµL, well below the level at which symptoms normally occur. A test that detects such low densities of parasites in a person with no symptoms is better considered a parasite detection or parasite screening test, rather than a diagnostic test.</p>

        <i>P. vivax</i> and <i>P. ovale</i> are also able to produce dormant schizonts in the liver known as hypnozoites that remain
        in the liver cells and can cause <b>relapses</b> weeks or years after apparent cure.
    </p>

    <p>
        <i>P. falciparum</i> and <i>P. malariae</i> infections may also recur after inadequate treatment and apparent cure; in these cases,
        the parasite remains in undetectably low levels in the blood and later may increase in density and cause symptoms, a process known as <b>recrudescence</b>.  In the case of <i>P. malariae</i>, recrudescence may occur decades later.

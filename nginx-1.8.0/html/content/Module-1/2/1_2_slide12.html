    <p>
        Algorithms can be adopted or designed to help with diagnosis, and a simple one is presented here, assuming one is examining a Giemsa-stained thin blood film.
    </p>

    <p>
        Thick blood films are better for detecting parasites; thin blood films are better for determining species and stage. Detection and identification of malaria parasites will be covered in detail in Module Three.
    </p>

    <p>
        In all cases, species should be identified only after examining several parasite stages in a blood film. You will be provided with this algorithm again in Module Three, where you can read through the descriptions and use the virtual slides provided to compare the findings.
    </p>

    <p>
        The following table summarises the findings for erythrocyte examinations, which will be revisited in Module Three:

                    Erythrocytes contain inclusions with red nucleus and blue cytoplasm.
                <br>
                    Think: <em>malaria present</em>
                </li><li>
                    Erythrocytes are normal size with delicate ring-shaped parasites, other stages rare or absent.
                <br>
                    Think <em>P. falciparum</em>

                    Erythrocyte stretched by crescentic or banana-shaped parasite.

                </li><li>
                    Erythrocytes are normal size with more robust or compact ring-shaped parasites, several other stages present.

                    Erythrocytes are enlarged, oval, stippled, fimbriated, other stages present.

        Gametocytes usually occur in much lower densities in blood than asexual parasites, and can cause transmission to mosquito vectors even when they cannot be detected by microscopy.  They may also persist for some weeks after treatment and cause transmission. 
    </p>

    <p>
        When gametocytes are ingested by a female <i>Anopheles</i> mosquito, the drop in temperature outside the body stimulates the microgamete to divide into eight flagellated microgametes. These attach to and fertilise macrogametes within the mosquito's stomach to form zygotes.
    </p>

    <p>
        After a few hours, the zygotes become motile ookinetes that penetrate the stomach wall of the mosquito to form spherical oocysts. Each oocyst grows and divides to produce about 1,000 sporocysts. Eventually the sporocysts rupture to release sporozoites that migrate to the salivary glands of the mosquito to await transmission to a new host when the mosquito feeds again.

    <p class="m-t-20">An understanding of the global malaria context will help you describe appropriate strategies for malaria control in your country or region. This is particularly important because malaria is a completely preventable disease.

    <ul class="u-list">

        <li id="01" class="list-timeout">
           1. Vector control through the use of Indoor Residual Spraying (IRS) and in some specific settings, larval control.</li>
        <li id="02" class="list-timeout">
            2. Personal protection through use of Insecticide Treated Nets (ITN), which also has a wider benefit in reducing vector populations.</li>
		<li id="03" class="list-timeout">
            3. Personal protection through use of repellent and insecticidal sprays, coils, and wearing long clothing after dark.</li>
    </ul>

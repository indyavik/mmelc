           In areas of stable malaria, anaemia is common and mortality is highest in children under two years of age. Asymptomatic infection may still occur in persistent, inadequately treated infections.
            </p>
    

            <p>
            In areas where malaria is periodic, little immunity develops within the population and mortality occurs more consistently across all age groups, including adults. This is sometimes known as unstable malaria.
            
            </p>
            <p>
                Understanding these considerations is vital for developing effective control programmes to reduce a population's exposure to infection, address mortality and potentially interrupt transmission. Therefore, malaria control programmes must be supported by rigorous and sustained surveillance.

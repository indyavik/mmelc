            <h3>Local Endemicity</h3>
            <p></p>

            <p>
           In areas of high malaria prevalence, where most of the population may be infected, individuals develop a high degree of immunity to malaria, and malaria infection in older children and adults may be asymptomatic or cause only mild disease.
            </p>
    

            <p>
           In these settings, known as stable malaria, the most vulnerable groups are young children who have not yet developed immunity to malaria; and pregnant women, whose immunity is decreased by pregnancy.

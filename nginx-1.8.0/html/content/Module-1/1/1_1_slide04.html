        Malaria occurs in the tropics and sub-tropics, concentrated in countries with lower incomes and often concentrated in populations with poor access to health services.

    <p>
        While malaria transmission has been reducing globally, in 2014 transmission remained in 97 countries, including most of Central and South America, Sub-Saharan Africa, Asia and the Western Pacific, with about 200 million cases and an estimated 600 thousand deaths. Approximately 90% of these deaths occurred in Africa, mainly in children under five years of age.

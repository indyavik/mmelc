     <p class="m-t-20">
         Other personal interventions that can be implemented to prevent and control malaria include the following:</p>

     <ul class="u-list">

         <li id="01" class="list-timeout">
             1. Where conditions are appropriate: Chemoprevention for the most vulnerable populations including Intermittent Preventive Treatment in Pregnancy
             (IPTp); Intermittent Preventive Treatment in Children less than 12 months of age (IPTc); and Seasonal Malaria
             Chemoprevention (SMC) in children less than six years of age.
         </li>
         <li id="02" class="list-timeout">
             2. In all cases: Confirmation of malaria diagnosis through microscopy or malaria Rapid Diagnostic Tests (RDT) for every
             suspected case before treatment.
         </li>
         <li id="03" class="list-timeout">
             3. In all cases: Timely treatment of confirmed cases with appropriate antimalarial medicines according to parasite species
             and documented drug resistance.         </li>
     </ul>

    <h3>Local Endemicity</h3>
    <p></p>

    <p>
        Malaria transmission depends on environmental and climatic factors such as temperature and rainfall. The malaria parasite cannot develop 
		in the mosquito at temperatures below 18<sup>o</sup>C, and thrives at temperatures above 22<sup>o</sup>C. Thus,
		even in malaria endemic countries, transmission decreases at higher altitudes and is not usually found at altitudes above 1,600 metres.
    </p>


    <p>
        <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> accounts for the majority of malaria infections globally; some species of malaria,
		such as <i>Plasmodium vivax</i>, may be more prevalent in cooler regions because it has greater tolerance to lower 
		ambient temperatures. Transmission may also be seasonal depending on rainfall and other climatic factors.
    </p>

    <p>
        It is expected that the areas compatible with malaria transmission will increase with global warming in the coming years.

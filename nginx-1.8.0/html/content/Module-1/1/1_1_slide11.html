    <h3>Diagnostic Challenges Related to Malaria Prevalence</h3>
    <p></p>

    <p>
        As a result of revitalised malaria control efforts in recent years, malaria transmission has markedly decreased in many regions. As a result of reduced exposure to malaria parasites, people in these regions tend to have less immunity and may therefore develop malaria symptoms and signs at lower parasite densities, and may be more likely to develop severe malaria.  A person who has never been previously exposed to malaria is classified as being "immunologically na√Øve" to malaria.

    <p>
        While malaria must be considered in any febrile episode in an at-risk population, it is important to remember that where transmission is low, there is a lower  probability that a fever episode will be due to malaria. While laboratory workers need to develop skills to identify other causes of fever and consider them in all situations, they should be particularly alert for non-malarial causes of fever in low-transmission settings.
